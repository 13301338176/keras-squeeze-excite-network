# Squeeze and Excitation Networks in Keras
Implementation of [Squeeze and Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf) in Keras 2.0+.

## Models
Current models supported :

- SE-ResNet. Custom ResNets can be built using the `SEResNet` model builder, whereas prebuilt Resnet models such as `SEResNet50`, `SEResNet101` and `SEResNet154` can also be built directly.
- SE-InceptionV3
- SE-Inception-ResNet-v2
- SE-ResNeXt

Additional models (not from the paper, not verified if they improve performance)
- SE-DenseNet
